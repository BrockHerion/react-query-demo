# React Query Demo

This is a simple demo of using React Query in a to-do app. It includes examples of

- [x] Data fetching with `useQuery`
- [x] Adding a new to-do with `useMutation`
- [x] Optimistic updates with `setQueryData`

The client was created using Vite and the server is a simple Express app with two endpoints. pnpm was used as the package manager.

Please feel free clone/fork this and play around with it! See if you can add new functionality, like removing a to-do when the checkbox is clicked.
